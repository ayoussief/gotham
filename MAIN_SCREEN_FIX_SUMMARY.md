# MainScreen Content Area Positioning Fix

## Problem
The main screen elements were not properly positioned within the content area bounds. Elements were being positioned relative to (0,0) instead of using absolute coordinates within the content area.

## Root Cause
The `PositionElementsDirectly()` method was using relative positioning instead of absolute positioning within the content area bounds.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `PositionElementsDirectly()` method
- Changed from relative positioning (starting at 0,0) to absolute positioning within content area bounds
- Now uses `content_x` and `content_y` as base coordinates
- All elements positioned relative to actual content area position

### 2. Fixed button positioning in Quick Actions Panel
- Buttons now positioned using absolute coordinates within content area
- `button_start_x` now calculated from `element_x` (absolute position)
- `button_y` now calculated from `current_y` (absolute position)

### 3. Fixed label positioning in Status and Activity Panels
- Status labels now positioned using absolute coordinates
- Activity labels now positioned using absolute coordinates  
- All labels use `element_x + padding` and `current_y + padding` as base positions

### 4. Fixed remaining height calculation
- Recent activity panel height calculation now uses proper content area bounds
- `remaining_height = (content_y + content_h) - current_y - padding`

## Expected Result
With content area bounds of (200, 80) size 1000x690:
- Quick Actions Panel should be positioned at approximately (224, 112) instead of (24, 112)
- All child elements should be contained within the content area bounds
- Content panel background should fill the entire content area
